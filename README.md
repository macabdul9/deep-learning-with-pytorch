# PyTorch is all you need

![alt text](assets/pytorch.png)


This repository has deep learning tutorials from basic to some advanced level, implemented using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch-Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) (occasionally). This work is mostly inspired by [Alfredo Canziani's](https://github.com/Atcold) [pytorch-Deep-Learning](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning) and [Yunjey Choi's](https://github.com/yunjey) [pytorch-tutorial](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial). The code in this repository is more readable and beginner friendly and often have useful descriptive comments. 

Feel free to create Issue/PR, I will be glad to collaborate

# Getting Started

- Create python virtual environment using **conda and environment.yml** or **virtuanev and install the dependencies from requirements.txt**, It is not necessary but strongly recommended to create virtual environment to avoid dependency conflict.
- Launch **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab** and you will be ready to execute the notebook.
- Some models may need a GPU to train on local machine otherwise you can use free GPU powered environment offered by [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/)
